<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This project is an algorithmic trading framework, built for swing trading stocks which have recently reported earnings.

Inspired by the trading methods of <a href="https://qullamaggie.com/">Kristjan Kullam√§gi</a> (Twitter: [@Qullamaggie](https://twitter.com/Qullamaggie)), this Bot is inteded to provide an algorithmic trading framework compatable with some of the strategies taught by Kris.

The general concept, is that this bot will monitor stocks as they report earnings, and will look for buy and sell signals, based on technical anaylsis.

The bot allows for different strategies to be back-tested against, and also to scan for the best past earners in order to identify what stocks were the best historic performers for research purposes.

The bot is setup to connect to Discord, and/or Telegram, and will send real-time updates as stocks are bought, or sold (Or purely in an informative way). In addition, it can identify when stocks have broken out.

The project uses:
* Python 3.9+
* Interactive Brokers TWS
* SQLLite database to cache historic OHLCV data and Earnings Calendar data
* Discord and Telegram Bot to receieve notifications and interact with the bot

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have an active Interactive Brokers account, and run the Trader Workstation, or IB Gateway applications on your machine. This Bot needs to use the API functionality exposed by one of those programs.

Follow the instructions here to [Enable the TWS API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/initial_setup.html)


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mpainenz/octopus.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

From the base directory, the [examply.py](examply.py) file demonstrates how to run a bot instance.

The bot can be as simple as the following code block:


```
from octopus import Octopus
from strategy.scan_earners import StrategyScanEarners


settings = {

    # Give each instance of the bot, a unique name.
    "INSTANCEID": "Example Name",

    # Trader Workstation (TWS) Settings
    "TWS":
        {
            "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
            "PORT": 7496, # Paper defaults to 7497
            "CLIENTID": 1000, #this needs to be a unique value for each bot instance. Chose a widely different value between bot instances, as each time a connection is retried, it's incremented by one.
            "MAXRETRY": 100
        },

    # Discord Notifications
    "DISCORD":
        {
            "TOKEN": "", # You can optionally setup a Discord Bot, and insert it's Token here to have Discord Chat Notifications enabled
            "CHANNEL": 0 # Channel to send alerts to
        },

    # Telegram Notifications
    "TELEGRAM":
        {
            "TOKEN": "", # You can optionally setup a Telegram Bot, and insert it's Token here to have Telegram Chat Notifications enabled
            "CHANNEL": 0 # Chat to send alerts to
        }

octopus = Octopus(settings)
octopus.run(StrategyScanEarners, backTest=True, backTestDateStartStr="2021-01-1", backTestDateEndStr="2021-01-10")
```

Running the above with the Python interpretter, will use the `StrategyScanEarners` Strategy Class, located in [strategy/scan_earners.py](strategy/earnings_breakouts.py), and will run in BackTesting mode. 

This mode is a dry run, and simulates what would occur when Stocks reporting earnings, are bought and sold after a short period.

   ```sh
   python example.py
   ```


If Discord or Telegram are enabled, the bot will run, and provide an output of stocks which gained over a certain threshold through the configured buy/sell period defined in the strategy.

As an example output from backtesting, VOLT reported earnings on the 12th of Jan, 2021. If bought, and sold 14 days later, a 26.83% Profit is detected by the bot:
